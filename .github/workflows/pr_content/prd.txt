This project aims to automate the creation of invoices in Fortnox when a deal in HubSpot reaches the "closedwon" stage. Upon a deal being marked as "closedwon," the system will automatically fetch relevant deal information from HubSpot, including contact details and line items. It will then search for or create a customer in Fortnox based on the contact information. Afterward, the system will retrieve the necessary articles from Fortnox that correspond to the line items in the deal. Finally, an invoice will be generated in Fortnox with all the relevant details. This automation streamlines the invoicing process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency while minimizing manual intervention.
