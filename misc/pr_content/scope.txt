The automation covers two main flows:
1. Deal Creation in HubSpot when an Offer is sent in Rackbeat.
   - Trigger: Offer sent in Rackbeat.
   - Actions: 
     - Fetch offer data from Rackbeat.
     - Create or update a company in HubSpot using the customerâ€™s contact email and other details from the offer.
     - Create a deal in HubSpot, associating it with the company and logging the process.

2. Deal Stage Change in HubSpot when an Offer is accepted and converted to an Order in Rackbeat.
   - Trigger: Offer accepted and converted to Order in Rackbeat.
   - Actions: 
     - Fetch order data from Rackbeat.
     - Update the existing deal in HubSpot using the Rackbeat Offer ID or create a new deal if the order was directly created without an associated offer.
     - Update the deal stage to 'closedwon' and adjust the deal amount and other relevant properties.

The automation ensures data consistency between Rackbeat and HubSpot, reducing manual data entry and improving accuracy.
